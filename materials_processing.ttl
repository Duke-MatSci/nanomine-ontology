# Glass Processing
:GlassProcessing a owl:Class; rdfs:subClassOf sio:Method.
:Viscosity rdfs:subClassOf sio:Quantity.
:Temperature rdfs:subClassOf sio:Quantity.
#Viscosity in relation to temperature
# Old:
:LongGlass
:ShortGlass
# New:
StrongGlass # Not actually strength
FragileGlass
:GlassTransitionTemperature

:Melting
 # needs homogeneous, clear glass
 # no bubbles (fining) 
 # removal of bubbles can be done by fining agents or by mechanical stirring or evacuation
Forming
  Plates # created by float method, on molten Tin bath in N2 gas atmosphere
  Fibers # glass melt is passed through a platinum sheet with thousands of holes about 10 um range
    Core: ~8 um in diameter
    Cladding: 125 um diameter
    Covered in blastic coating
    n_core > n_cladding produces total internal reflection
    low optical loss achieved by reducing impurities
  Tubes
  Lens
  Bottles
  others
Cooling
Annealing # All but fibers (removal of residual stress)
  # Heat treatment at glass transition temperature
Strengthening # (Physical tempering?)
  # heat up to 300 C, differential temperature results in compressive stress on the outside
  # chemical tempering: ion exchange (gorilla glass)
  # can be used to create a refractive difference.

  heat management
Asphalt Concrete
  mixing plan is the same
  binder is viscoelastic material (petrolium extract)

PolymerProcessing
  Extrusion
Solid polymer -> heated barrel with screw (shears material, forces extrusion) (need to balance temperature and shear rate along the barrel)-> pressure flow 
    Blown film manufacture - pressure of air determines 
Injection Molding
  Starts with extruder, force polymer into mold
  Parameters: temperature of the mold, pressure of the runner (channels to fill the mold)
  Results: residual stress, incomplete filling, crystal size
Properties:
Viscosity (function of temperature and strain rate (shear rate))
Morphology development (semicrystalline, amorphous)
Linear or crosslinked final polymer

RotationalMolding 
beads are melted and stick to inside surface of mold (trash cans, etc)

BlowMolding
Extruder, compressed air, mold around the cylinder
